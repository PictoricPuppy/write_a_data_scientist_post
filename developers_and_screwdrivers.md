**Covid-19, developers and screwdrivers**

¿What were you doing when Covid-19 spread? ¿Did the pandemic affected your professional life?

As an electronic engineer related to the automation industry, the pandemic did not really affect my professional life and gave me things 
I could never have wished for, such as a hybrid job mode. But for some of my friends, it was a different story. The cooks had to learn 
to program and change their profession.
The IT sector has always been a growing sector. For years now, it seems that there are never enough programmers, and the job offers are
very attractive. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for more development profiles. 
In this post, I will explore if this was reflected in the annual surveys conducted in the following years by one of the most important
developer communities on the internet and answer three main questions. 

  •	Did the number of professional developers increase after the pandemic?
  •	Is the IT development still popular? 
  •	How old are the new developers?
  •	Did exist any correlation between age and employment, which could mean that after the pandemic 
    different profiles started working as developers?
  
**Did the number of professional developers increase after the pandemic?**

In order to analyze this question, we gathered the data from the year 2019 to 2022 and calculated the number of individuals who worked 
as developer and had less than a year of experience in coding. Surprisingly, the number of new developers decreased after the pandemic, 
compared to previous years.
 

**So, what is going on, is still the IT development world popular?**
In order to analyze this assumption, I decided to investigate the number of individuals who are new programming enthusiasts.
After gathering and filtering the data regarding new programmers by hobby or due to learning issues, we could see the following pattern.
 
In this case, there is an increase in the number of individuals who started programming after the pandemic, either as a hobby or because 
of their studies. 1041 in 2022 vs 757 in 2019. This confirms our assumption, that the general interest in software development has grown. 
But as we have seen above, this popularity for software development is not reflected in the evolution of the number of new professional 
programmers in the years after 2020. ¿How can we explain this phenomenon? ¿Does this have any relationship with age factor?

**How old are the new developers?**

For answering this question, I calculated the average age in professional and amateur world.
 
After analyzing the average ages, we observe that both the professional and amateur branches follow the same pattern. During 2019 and 2020,
both new amateurs and new professional developers had an average age of 25 years. But from 2021 onwards, the age of professional programmers 
rose to 29. Did the hiring parameters change after the pandemic? 

**What is the relationship between age and hiring?**

To try to answer this question and see if there is a relationship between age and employment, I conducted some linear regression analysis for
years 2019, 2021 and 2022.
In 2019 there seemed to be a strong relation between any type of employment and age, with a R-squared of 0,09. Albeit, after 2020 this strong
relationship turned into a weak one, with a R-squared of 0,013 in 2022.

**Conclusions**

Although from outside the sector we perceive that the IT development world is booming, and we see more and more people retraining and breaking 
into the sector, these data have not been significant to those reported in the Stackoverflow survey.
Nor have we seen a significant change in the average age of new professional programmers, which would indicate that some individuals have decided 
to change careers. 
The results of our linear regressions, however, show that after the pandemic there is no strong correlation between age and type of employment, 
so this could mean that the selection criteria have broadened after the pandemic. Thus, allowing for more diversity in the software developer workforce.
